Write a Python program to compute the areas of a triangle and a circle using user-
provided inputs.
Task 1: Calculate the Area of a Triangle
 Use the input() function to ask the user to enter the base of the triangle.
 Use the input() function again to ask for the height of the triangle.
 Convert these inputs into floating-point numbers using float() since the inputs are
strings by default.
 Use the formula 0.5 * base * height to compute the area of the triangle.
 Use the print() function to output the computed area of the triangle with a
descriptive label (e.g., &quot;The area of the triangle is:&quot;).
Task 2: Calculate the Area of a Circle
 Use the input() function to ask the user to enter the radius of the circle.
 Convert this input into a floating-point number using float().
 Use the formula 3.14 * radius ** 2 to compute the area of the circle.
 Use the print() function to output the computed area of the circle with a
descriptive label (e.g., &quot;The area of the circle is:&quot;).
